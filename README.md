5️⃣ the final sub-project of intro to game dev: a life/farming-sim with scene switching, state management, various entity ai types and graphics using purely raylib & C++.

a relatively advanced project but mostly due to the mechanisms involved in making it:
- multi-layered map system building off of a pre-existing map class
- intricate tool behaviors provided by an entity class
- sound effects & complete visual style that boosts immersion
